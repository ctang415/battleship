The battleship project felt a lot less daunting to take on because I started off creating test cases for all the functions I needed before writing any code. If there's anything I struggled with while creating the game, it was figuring out how to make touch events that replicated the drag and drop effect on desktop. I managed to get the touch event to pick up the touched div, but I couldn't make it move along the grid, so I used Bernardo Castilho's drag and drop script (https://github.com/Bernardo-Castilho/dragdroptouch) for the mobile touches and it worked perfectly.
If I had to revisit this project later, I would definitely work on improving the AI attacks. I imagine I would store the four possible attacks that one can make after landing a hit and running through those coordinates until I land another hit. Once I land a second hit, I would check to see if the x or y coordinate increased, so that I can determine which direction the ship is facing and based on that information, I would continue along both ends of the axis until I miss. Once both ends result in misses, I would know that the ship was sunk, so I would go back to shooting randomly until I land a hit and repeat the process.
